Some frameworks for servers side

## Some remarks
[Here you can find some benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#hw=ph&test=composite&section=data-r22)
Some scores:
- express is placed at 130 place
- fast api is 86
- django is 143
- koa is 117

If you look for performance you should not use python frameworks


## Fastapi python

If you want to quicly develop some application for your own use you can take advantage of [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
As the authors say: "FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints". DEfinitely it is very convenient to use, e.g. documentation is generated automatically, moreover, there is interactive api which helps you test requests to your api. You can find [tutorial here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/)


## Koa

This [framework](https://koajs.com/) is very similar to the express (no suprise because it is designed by the team behind Express) one but is slightly faster according to the mentioned benchmark. It uses concepts of `api.context` which encapsulates responses and requests.
